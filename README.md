# Cliquer for Mathematica

This is a [Cliquer](http://users.aalto.fi/~pat/cliquer.html) interface for [Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/).  Cliquer is a [clique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_(graph_theory)) finding library.

##Installation

Currently this package has only been tested on OS X.

Download Cliquer and place all the files in a directory called `cliquer` next to `Cliquer.m`.  Compile it per the instructions, and leave the object files in place.  Load `Cliquer.m` in Mathematica, which should auto-compile the interface.
